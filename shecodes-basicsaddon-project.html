    <p>
      The Second City is an improvisational comedy enterprise. It's the oldest
      improvisational theater troupe to be continuously based in Chicago and has
      become one of the most influential and prolific comedy theatres in the
      English-speaking world.
      <br />
      <br />
      Improvisational theatre, often called improvisation or improv, is the form
      of theatre, often comedy, in which most or all of what is performed is
      unplanned or unscripted, created spontaneously by the performers. In its
      purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created
      collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present
      time, without use of an already prepared, written script.
